            I begin this journery, which is call the <b>Hendrix Journery</b> it's where I took gap or distance myself from
            scoial media quite some time. <br>
            Where I try to find myself and try to understand myself has a person as a whole, well in those cases I develop
            certain skills or better myself in certain aspect,<br>
            where as I wasn't comfortable interacting with people, now I interact with people and get along well, such as
            coopeate with people.<br>
            Where I also develop my skill in being a hard-working person, by driving hard to reach my goals and try
            step-by-step to meet them. <br> It's still a process in which I'm
            trying to learn each day, I know sometimes i s and fall and makes mistakes, but I still try my best to stay on
            that goal.
