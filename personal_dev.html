                        <p>As an introverted person, asking for help is pretty challenging, so i have to depend on myself at times so problem solving is a strenght 
                            that i think has helped me alot. <br> Over the years in order to develop this strenth <br> i've tried to deevelop my critical thinking skills through activities such as reading, writing, and discussions. <br>
                            Another method i've used, is by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. <br>
                             This will make it easier to understand the problem and
                            develop a solution.

                        <p>Additionally, being a leader can also be a source of personal growth and development as it often requires <br>individuals to
                        take on new challenges and responsibilities. because i hate to tell people what to doI've always hated the idea of being a leader <br>
                        but over the years i've realized that people often jump at the chance for me to be the leader, never liked it and as soon <br>
                        as someone with better leadership qualities comes along i tend to relax and let them take over. <br> In doing so i realized that i miss out on many opportunities
                        to learn and try different things. Since college i've stopped shying away from leadership <br> roles and start embracing it.  </p>

            <p>12 Pillars is a book that has inspired many, this was a book written by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener <br>
            After reflecting, here's how i think the reading could be applied and change my life.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 4 "Writing definite goals"</h2>
            </font>
            
            <p>
                Chapter 4 speaks of writing definite goals, whether long term or short term. There’s a quote in the novel, it’s not
                about getting rich but who you become along the journey to get rich. after reading chapter 4,<br> instead of setting long-term goals, I will now set short-term objectives to reach towards those
                goals, with dates by which I should’ve accomplished those objectives, I will also celebrate the minor milestones because
                it is those milestones <br> that will motivate me to move on to the next objective. Another thing I will also do is write
                down those goals
                somewhere where I will see them and not stumble on them like in previous occurrences.

                <h2>Chapter 5 "The proper use of time”</h2>
            </font>
            <p>
                This chapter made me realize that the more you waste your days doing everything that is not aligned with your goals, is
                the closer you’ll get to stuck in the “system. I will ensure that as a college student I don’t get so caught up <br> trying
                to fit in or be a part of a cliché that I waste my time. The journey to becoming successful comes with one hard truth,
                the friends, or people you surround yourself with can determine who you become.

                <h2>Chapter 6 “Surround yourself with the best people”</h2>

            </font>
            <p>Personally, I can say this process will get lonely, because if I start to question the people I surround myself with, I
            will have to come to the hard truth that they don’t align with my goal, what I’ll do is slowly distant myself from these
            people,<br> I’ll try to show them the path I’ve taken and if they see this path as one to take then I’ll encourage them to
            do the same, but if not, then I’ll kindly ask them to respect my wishes to move on, I’ll be ready to accept the
            loneliness of this journey, if they wish to join, great, <br> if not then I’ll move on with my life and hope for nothing but
            the best for them.</p>

            </font>
            <p>
                Many successful people today have read thousands of books and to date they still try to read or have meaningful
                conversations to widen the scope of their knowledge. <br> I will try to read more, that’s one of my many failures on my
                journey, and that’s to read. I will be sure to improve this.
